%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Aufgabe 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{}
%https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/85363/simple-examples-of-uncorrelated-but-not-independent-x-and-y
\begin{proof}
	Let $X \sim \Uni((-1,1))$ and $Y = X^2$ are dependent. And they are uncorrelated.
	Calculate the $\Corr(X,Y) = 0$!
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Aufgabe 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{}
%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value Countably infinite case
\begin{proof}
	
\end{proof}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Aufgabe 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{}
\begin{proof}
	
\end{proof}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Aufgabe 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{}
\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item\
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \ul{pgf:} From Definition 5.14 from lecture we have
			\begin{align*}
				\psi_X(s) = \sum_{x \ge 0} \rho(x)s^x
				\intertext{and from definition of the Poisson distribution we get}
				\rho_X(k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!} \quad \forall k \in \N, k\ge 0.
				\intertext{Follows}
				\psi_X(s) &= \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!}s^k\\
				&=e^{-\lambda} \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{(\lambda s)^k}{k!}\\
				&=e^{-\lambda}e^{\lambda s} \quad \text{ Taylor Exp for $e$-function}\\
				&= e^{-\lambda + \lambda s}
			\end{align*}
			\item \ul{exptected value:}
			\begin{align*}
				\E[X] = \psi'_X(s=1) = \lambda\psi_X(s=1) = \lambda
			\end{align*}
			\item \ul{variance:}
			\begin{align*}
				\Var X &= \psi''_X(1) + \psi'_X(1) - (\psi'_X(1))^2\\
				&= \lambda^2 + \lambda - \lambda^2\\
				&= \lambda
			\end{align*}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item see links
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Aufgabe 5 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{}
\begin{proof}
	Let $X,Y \in \L^2(\O, \F, \meas)$ real random variables.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \ul{To show:} $\Var(X+Y) - \Var(X-Y) = 4\Cov(X,Y)$
		
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
