%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Aufgabe 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{}
\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item This is known as the $Z$-transform in statistics ($Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$). With the help of lecture notes (chap 7.1 remark after definition 7.1) we find
		\begin{align*}
		\E[Z] = \E[\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}] = \frac{1}{\sigma}\E[(X)-\mu] = 0\\
		\Var(Z) = \Var(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}) = \Var(\frac{X}{\sigma}) = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\Var(X) = 1
		\end{align*}
		(This follows with properties of $\E \and \Var$ we proved earlier in lecture.)
		and this gives us already the claim.
		\item 
	\end{enumerate}
